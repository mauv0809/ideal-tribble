# Matchmaking System TODO

## Overview
This branch (`feature/matchmaking-system`) implements a matchmaking feature for the Padel club Slack bot. Users can request matches via `/match` command, indicate availability with emoji reactions, and receive match proposals with team assignments.

## Architecture
- **Database**: SQLite with migrations for match requests and player availability
- **Slack Integration**: Events API for reactions, slash commands, new member welcome
- **Matchmaking Service**: Handles match creation, availability collection, and proposals
- **Player Mapping**: Fuzzy search system to link Slack users to Playtomic profiles

## üöß PENDING TASKS

### 13. Match Detection & Completion System (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **What**: Detect when proposed matches are booked on Playtomic and mark requests as completed
- **Requirements**:
  - Enhance `/fetch` endpoint to check for matches matching proposed requests
  - Match by date, time range, booking responsible player, and team composition
  - Update match request status to `StatusCompleted` when detected
  - Handle edge cases (partial matches, time variations)
- **Files to modify**: `internal/http/handlers/scheduled.go`, `internal/matchmaking/store.go`

### 14. Dynamic Team Reassignment (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **What**: Handle availability changes after match proposal with automatic team reassignment
- **Requirements**:
  - Until a match is booked through playtomic and fetched (so until we have set the match request status to StatusCompleted) we need to be ready for new team assignments if we suddenly dont have availability of the 4 propsoed players

  - Detect when availability drops below 4 players after proposal
  - Detect when availability increases to 5+ players after proposal
  - Automatically reassign teams and update proposal
  - Send updated proposal notification
  - Handle edge cases (booking responsible player leaves, etc.)
- **Files to modify**: `internal/http/handlers/slack_events.go`, `internal/matchmaking/store.go`

### 15. Team Assignment Enhancement (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **What**: Improve team balancing algorithm in ProposeMatch
- **Requirements**:
  - Balance teams by skill level (use existing player levels from database)
  - Consider player preferences/partnerships (future enhancement)
  - Handle odd number of players (>4 available)
- **Files to modify**: `internal/matchmaking/store.go` (enhance ProposeMatch method)

### 16. Cleanup Job (LOW PRIORITY)
- **What**: Remove old match request data after completion
- **Requirements**:
  - Clean up player availability records for completed matches
  - Archive or remove old match requests
  - Prevent database bloat
  - Run periodically via scheduled endpoint
- **Files to create**: New cleanup service or enhance existing processor

### 17. End-to-End Testing (LOW PRIORITY)
- **What**: Test complete matchmaking flow
- **Requirements**:
  - Test `/match` command ‚Üí availability collection ‚Üí match proposal ‚Üí booking detection
  - Test dynamic team reassignment scenarios
  - Test edge cases (not enough players, no availability overlap)
  - Test new member onboarding flow
  - Verify Slack webhook event handling

## üîÑ CURRENT WORKFLOW STATUS

### ‚úÖ Working Flow:
1. ‚úÖ User runs `/match` command
2. ‚úÖ System creates match request and sends availability message
3. ‚úÖ Players react with day emojis (1Ô∏è‚É£-7Ô∏è‚É£)
4. ‚úÖ System processes reactions and stores availability
5. ‚úÖ System automatically analyzes availability and proposes matches
6. ‚úÖ System sends match proposal with team assignments and booking responsibility

### üöß Remaining Flow:
7. ‚ùå Player books match on Playtomic (external action)
8. ‚ùå System detects booked match via fetch endpoint and marks request as completed

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS TO RESUME WORK

### ‚úÖ RECENTLY COMPLETED:
- **Task #11**: Automatic Match Proposal Workflow - ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **Task #12**: Deadlock Resolution & Debugging System - ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Task #13 - Match Detection & Completion System

1. **Enhance fetch endpoint for match detection**
   - Modify `/fetch` endpoint to check for matches matching active proposals
   - Match criteria: date, time range, booking responsible player, team composition
   - Add method `DetectMatchedRequests()` to matchmaking service

2. **Implement completion workflow**
   - Update match request status to `StatusCompleted` when match detected
   - Handle partial matches and edge cases

### SECONDARY PRIORITY: Task #14 - Dynamic Team Reassignment

1. **Monitor availability changes during proposal phase**
   - Modify reaction handlers to check if match request is in `StatusProposingMatch`
   - When availability changes, re-evaluate if current proposal is still valid
   - Trigger new proposal if team composition changes

2. **Handle reassignment scenarios**
   - Player leaves (4‚Üí3): Try to find replacement or cancel proposal
   - Player joins (4‚Üí5): Reassign teams with new player
   - Booking responsible player leaves: Reassign booking responsibility

### TERTIARY PRIORITIES:
- **Task #15**: Enhance team balancing with skill levels  
- **Task #16**: Cleanup jobs for old data
- **Task #17**: End-to-end testing

## üí° IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Player Mapping:
- Uses fuzzy search with confidence scoring
- Auto-maps high confidence matches (>0.8)
- Requires manual confirmation for medium confidence (0.5-0.8)
- New members get welcome message with Playtomic profile setup

### Availability Collection:
- Emoji reactions: 1Ô∏è‚É£=Monday, 2Ô∏è‚É£=Tuesday, etc.
- Only processes reactions on active match request messages
- Handles both addition and removal of reactions
- Filters by club channel ID to ignore other channels

### Database Design:
- `match_requests` table tracks overall match requests
- `match_request_availability` table tracks individual player availability
- Foreign key relationships ensure data integrity
- Indexes on frequently queried fields for performance

The matchmaking system will be complete when:
- [ ] A user can run `/match` and get a fully organized match with teams
- [ ] All players receive clear booking instructions
- [ ] The system handles edge cases gracefully
